Data Insights with Google Colab &amp; Power BI
As part of the project, I conducted an analysis of customer behavior, considering the distribution by gender and age groups. I identified product categories that are most popular and generate the primary demand, driving the companyâ€™s profit.

I also analyzed the impact of existing marketing programs and provided recommendations for improvement.

I examined customer preferences for payment methods and delivery options, assessing how they influence customer behavior, including factors that lead to order cancellations. All findings were supported by visualizations.

Furthermore, I provided recommendations that can positively affect user behavior, stimulate customer activity, and increase the company's cash flow.
