# Mobile-Devices-Sales-Analysis-2023-2024

Data Insights with Google Colab &amp; Power BI

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze sales data for electronic mobile devices to identify user behavior. This dataset contains sales transaction records for an electronics company over a one-year period, spanning from September 2023 to September 2024. It includes detailed information about customer demographics, product types, and purchase behaviors.

## Dataset and Data Preparation
The "Customer purchase behavior - Electronic Sales Data" includes customer purchasing behavior and demographics in the electronics market, covering:

 • **Customer Information:** Customer ID, Age, Gender, Loyalty Member.

 • **Product Information:** Type, SKU, Rating.

 • **Transaction Information:** Order Status, Payment Method, Total Price, Unit Price, Quantity, Purchase Date, Shipping Date, Add-ons Purchased, Add-on Total.

• **The Data source was the dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cameronseamons/electronic-sales-sep2023-sep2024/data

## Tools used for analysis

• **Pandas** - for data processing, grouping, aggregation, and calculating correlations.

• **Matplotlib** - for visualisation of analysis results, creation of graphs (bar plots, pie chart).

• **Seaborn** - for styling graphs and enhancing the visualisation of relationships between variables.

• **Correlation** - to determine the statistical relationship between several variables.

## Key actions

• As part of the project, I conducted an analysis of customer behavior, considering the distribution by gender and age groups.

• I identified product categories that are most popular and generate the primary demand, driving the company’s profit.

• I also analyzed the impact of existing marketing programs and provided recommendations for improvement.

• I examined customer preferences for payment methods and delivery options, assessing how they influence customer behavior, including factors that lead to order cancellations. All findings were supported by visualizations.

## Key Recommendations

• **Loyalty program:** It is necessary to consider additional promotions, cooperation with other companies, bonuses and discounts for users participating in the loyalty program.

• **Orders Volume:** It is necessary to take into account seasonal fluctuations in sales. Since the dataset does not contain information on sales regions, which is a disadvantage in the analysis. The sales region would allow us to adjust the assessment of user behavior relative to location and cultural differences.

• **Order Cancellation:** It is necessary to take into account that order cancellations can be caused by various factors, accordingly, it is worth considering them in a complex. Implementation of a customer feedback system will help to identify the reasons for cancellations and improve the quality of service.
